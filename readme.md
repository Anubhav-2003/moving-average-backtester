# Backtesting System

## Overview

### What is Backtesting?

A **Backtesting System allows** a trader to simulate a trading strategy using **historical data** to generate results and analyze risk and profitability before risking any actual capital.

A well-conducted backtest that yields positive results assures traders that the strategy is fundamentally sound and is likely to yield profits when implemented in reality. In contrast, a well-conducted backtest that yields suboptimal results will prompt traders to alter or reject the strategy.

By running your strategy against real market data, backtesting allows you to:

- Assess how the strategy would have behaved under different market conditions.
- Test different parameters and refine the strategy for optimal performance.
- Identify potential weaknesses in the strategy and make improvements before live deployment.
